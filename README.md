# White-wine-quality-prediction
Predicted white wine quality using Random Forest, SVM and KNN based on physicochemical tests dataset.


The data is Vinho Verde* white wine samples from Portugal.   
The goal of this project is to determine wine quality based on the chemical properties.  
● Input variable: based on physicochemical tests   
● Output variable: based on sensory data, median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts
